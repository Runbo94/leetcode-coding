# The Cost of a Tree

一道 Mathworks 的 OA 题，做的时候点到了屏幕外面，直接跳出来了 gg，一千头草泥马奔过，下回做要全屏的 OA，可不敢再连第二屏幕了。难受~
题目描述：

例子：
9, 7, 8, 1, 3, 2 正确结果是 161<br>

|     | 9   | 7   | 8   | 1   | 3   | 2   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9   |
| 7   |
| 8   |
| 1   |
| 3   |
| 2   |

首先单元素数组无法运算，先假设是 0.
| | 9 | 7 | 8 | 1 | 3 | 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9 | 0 |
| 7 | | 0 |
| 8 | | | 0 |
| 1 | | | | 0 |
| 3 | | | | | 0 |
| 2 | | | | | | 0 |
如果数组是双元素，结果显然结果是两个元素相乘。
| | 9 | 7 | 8 | 1 | 3 | 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9 | 0 | 63 |
| 7 | | 0 | 56 |
| 8 | | | 0 | 8 |
| 1 | | | | 0 | 3 |
| 3 | | | | | 0 | 6|
| 2 | | | | | | 0 |
接下来是这道 dp 的核心关键，当元素数量大于 2，该怎么办，比如[9, 7, 8], 我们可以选 9,7 为一组，8 单独，[[9, 7], 8];或者 9 单独， 7,8 为一组，[9, [7, 8]]; 而且我们这时还需要记录每个区间的最大值是多少，比如[9, 7]的最大值是 9, 8 的最大值是 8，所以[[9, 7], 8]的 root 节点的值是 9\*8=72；
记录区间最大值的矩阵：
| | 9 | 7 | 8 | 1 | 3 | 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 |9 |
| 7 | | 7 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 |
| 8 | | | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 |
| 1 | | | | 1 | 3 | 3 |
| 3 | | | | | 3 | 3|
| 2 | | | | | | 2 |
再回到之前的[9, 7, 8], 当分组是[[9, 7], 8]时，[9, 7]结果的最小 cost 是 63， [8]结果的最小 cost 不存在，所以是 0
| | 9 | 7 | 8 | 1 | 3 | 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9 | 0 | **63** |
| 7 | | 0 | 56 |
| 8 | | | **0** | 8 |
| 1 | | | | 0 | 3 |
| 3 | | | | | 0 | 6|
| 2 | | | | | | 0 |
左子树的最大值取 9， 右子树取 8
| | 9 | 7 | 8 | 1 | 3 | 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9 | 9 | **9** | 9 | 9 | 9 |9 |
| 7 | | 7 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 |
| 8 | | | **8** | 8 | 8 | 8 |
| 1 | | | | 1 | 3 | 3 |
| 3 | | | | | 3 | 3|
| 2 | | | | | | 2 |
所以结果是 63 + 0 + 9*8 = 135；
当分组是[9, [7, 8]]时，[9]结果的是零，[7, 8]结果是 56
| | 9 | 7 | 8 | 1 | 3 | 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9 | **0** | 63 |
| 7 | | 0 | **56** |
| 8 | | | 0 | 8 |
| 1 | | | | 0 | 3 |
| 3 | | | | | 0 | 6|
| 2 | | | | | | 0 |
对应的左右子树最大值是
| | 9 | 7 | 8 | 1 | 3 | 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9 | **9** | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 |9 |
| 7 | | 7 | **8** | 8 | 8 | 8 |
| 8 | | | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 |
| 1 | | | | 1 | 3 | 3 |
| 3 | | | | | 3 | 3|
| 2 | | | | | | 2 |
结果是 0 + 56 + 9*8 = 128；所以最小是 128

|     | 9   | 7   | 8   | 1   | 3   | 2   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9   | 0   | 63  | 128 |
| 7   |     | 0   | 56  |
| 8   |     |     | 0   | 8   |
| 1   |     |     |     | 0   | 3   |
| 3   |     |     |     |     | 0   | 6   |
| 2   |     |     |     |     |     | 0   |

接下来直接表格演示

- [7, 8, 1]

  - [7, [8, 1]]
    | | 9 | 7 | 8 | 1 | 3 | 2 |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | 9 | 0 | 63 | 128
    | 7 | | **0** | 56 |
    | 8 | | | 0 | **8** |
    | 1 | | | | 0 | 3 |
    | 3 | | | | | 0 | 6|
    | 2 | | | | | | 0 |

    |     | 9   | 7     | 8   | 1     | 3   | 2   |
    | --- | --- | ----- | --- | ----- | --- | --- |
    | 9   | 9   | 9     | 9   | 9     | 9   | 9   |
    | 7   |     | **7** | 8   | 8     | 8   | 8   |
    | 8   |     |       | 8   | **8** | 8   | 8   |
    | 1   |     |       |     | 1     | 3   | 3   |
    | 3   |     |       |     |       | 3   | 3   |
    | 2   |     |       |     |       |     | 2   |

    result: 0 + 8 + 7\*8 = 64

  - [[7, 8], 1]
    | | 9 | 7 | 8 | 1 | 3 | 2 |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | 9 | 0 | 63 | 128
    | 7 | | 0 | **56** |
    | 8 | | | 0 | 8 |
    | 1 | | | | **0** | 3 |
    | 3 | | | | | 0 | 6|
    | 2 | | | | | | 0 |

    |     | 9   | 7   | 8     | 1     | 3   | 2   |
    | --- | --- | --- | ----- | ----- | --- | --- |
    | 9   | 9   | 9   | 9     | 9     | 9   | 9   |
    | 7   |     | 7   | **8** | 8     | 8   | 8   |
    | 8   |     |     | 8     | 8     | 8   | 8   |
    | 1   |     |     |       | **1** | 3   | 3   |
    | 3   |     |     |       |       | 3   | 3   |
    | 2   |     |     |       |       |     | 2   |

    result: 56 + 0 + 8 = 64

  - result
    | | 9 | 7 | 8 | 1 | 3 | 2 |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | 9 | 0 | 63 | 128
    | 7 | | 0 | 56 | 64
    | 8 | | | 0 | 8 |
    | 1 | | | | 0 | 3 |
    | 3 | | | | | 0 | 6|
    | 2 | | | | | | 0 |

省略后面的结果， 直接算[9, 7, 8, 1]
