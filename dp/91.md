# 91. Decode Ways

[原题链接](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/)<br>
Input: "226"<br>
It could be decoded as "BZ"(2 26), "VF"(22 6), or "BBF"(2 2 6)<br>

1. If the string is "2", there is just one possible result - "B"
   | "" | 2 | 2 | 6 |
   |----|---|---|--|
   |1 | 1 |
   | [] |[2]|
2. If the string is "22", the combinations would be [2,2] or [22], in other words, the last element could be one digit or two digits. When the last element is just one digit, here is 2, and we will check how many possible result when the string is just "2".
   | "" | 2 | 2 | 6 |
   |----|---|---|--|
   |1 | **1** |
   | [] |[2]| [2, 2]
   When the last element is two digits, here is 22, first, 22 is between 1 and 26, therefore, it is valid. Then we will check how many possible result when the string is an empty string.
   | "" | 2 | 2 | 6 |
   |----|---|---|--|
   |**1** | 1 |
   | [] |[2]| [22]
   Therefore, the the number of ways to decode the string "22" is 1 + 1 = 2.

   | ""  | 2   | 2           | 6   |
   | --- | --- | ----------- | --- |
   | 1   | 1   | 2           |
   | []  | [2] | [2, 2],[22] |

3. If the last element is one digit.
   | "" | 2 | 2 | 6 |
   | --- | --- | ----------- | --- |
   | 1 | 1 | **2** |
   | [] | [2] | [2, 2],[22] |[2, 2, 6], [22, 6]
   If the last element is two digit. Here is "26", it is valid too.
   | "" | 2 | 2 | 6 |
   | --- | --- | ----------- | --- |
   | 1 | **1** | 2 | |
   | [] | [2] | [2, 2],[22] | [2, 26]
   Therefore, the number of ways to decode the "226" is 3.
   | "" | 2 | 2 | 6 |
   | --- | --- | ----------- | --- |
   | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3|
   | [] | [2] | [2, 2],[22] |[2, 2, 6], [22, 6][2, 26]
