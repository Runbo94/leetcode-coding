# 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

To solve this problem, we need to understand "What is the use of median". In statistics, the median is used for _dividing a set into two equal length subsets, that one subset is always greater than the other._ If we understand the use of median for dividing, we are very close to the answer.

First let's cut A into two parts at a random position i:

```
        left_A         |        right_A
A[0], A[1], ..., A[i-1]| A[i], A[i+1], ..., A[m-1]
```

Since **A** has **m** elements, so there are **m+1** kinds of cutting(**i=0~m**). And we know: **len(left_A)=i, len(right_A)=m-i**. Note: when **i=0**, **left_A** is empty, and when **i=m**, **right_A** is empty.

```
        left_B         |        right_B
B[0], B[1], ..., B[j-1]| B[j], B[j+1], ..., B[n-1]
```

Put **left_A** and **left_B** into one set, and put **right_A** and **right_B** into another set. Let's name them **left_part** and **right_part**:

```
        left_part         |        right_part
A[0], A[1], ..., A[i-1]| A[i], A[i+1], ..., A[m-1]
B[0], B[1], ..., B[j-1]| B[j], B[j+1], ..., B[n-1]
```

If we can ensure:

1. len(left_part) == len(right_part)
2. max(left_part) <= min(right_part)

then we divide all elements in **{A, B}** into two parts with equal length, and one part is always greater than the other. Then **median = (max(left_part) + min(right_part))/2**.

To ensure these two conditions, we just need to ensure:

1. i + j == m - i + n - j (or: m - i + n - j + 1) if n >= m, we just need to set: i = 0 ~ m, j = (m + n + 1)/2 - i
2. B[j - 1] <= A[i] and A[i - 1] <= B[j]

ps. 1 For simplicity, I presume **A[i - 1], B[j - 1], A[i], B[j]** are always valid even if **i=0/i=m/j=0/j=n**. I will talk about how to deal with these edge values at last.
ps. 2 Why n>=m? Because I have to make sure j is non-negative since 0<=i<=m and j = (m+n+1)/2 - i. If n < m, then j may be negative, that will lead to wrong result.

So, all we need to do is:

```
    Searching i in [0, m], to find an object 'i' that:
        B[j-1] <= A[i] and A[i-1] <= B[j], (where j = (m + n + 1)/2 - i)
```

And we can do a binary search following steps described below:

1. Set imin = 0, imax = m, then start searching in [imin, imax]
2. Set i = (imin + imax)/2, j = (m + n + 1)/2 - i
3. Now we have len(left_part) == len(right_part). And there are only 3 situations that we may encounter:

   a. B[j-1] <= A[i] and A[i-1] <= B[j]
   Means we have found the object `i`, so stop searching
   b. B[j-1] > A[i]
   Means A[i] is too small. we must `adjust` i to get `B[j-1] <= A[i]`. --> increase i, That is, we must adjust the searching range to [i+1, imax]. So, set imin = i+1, and goto <2>.
   c. A[i-1] > B[j]
   Means A[i-1] is too big. And we must decrease i to get A[i-1]<=B[j]. That is, we must ajust the searching range to [imin, i-1]. So, set imax = i - 1, and goto <2>.

When the object **i** is found, the median is:
max
